# surfs_up

### Overview of the project
The purpose of this project is to analyze the temperature in Oahu before opening a surf shop. As interest for the months of June and December was shown, the numbers were filtered and analyzed to take into account to consider the opening of the local. Numbers were separated into a list and screened into a DataFrame which can be easily analyzed without needing to enter to the datasets. 

### Results
- The average temperature of June is just 3.9F higher than in December, not as much as one would think. 
- The minimum temperature of December is 8F lower than in June (56F vs 64F).
- The maximum temperature of June is just 2F higher than in December (83F vs 85).
